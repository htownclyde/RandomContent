# random_image.py

This program generates a random valid URL to an imagehosting site such as Imgur or ImgBB, then opens it in a GUI window.

It is mostly a for-fun time-waster, but in the future it may support sites like YouTube or Spotify, and even be able to select a random piece of content within a specific category (song genre, video publish date, etc.) defined by the user.

Warning: The images that appear are totally random. This program is not able to filter them. Use at your own risk!
